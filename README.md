The Mathswatch Answer Orchard is a set of answers for mathswatch questions. The point of this is not to create a needless hub for cheating from students who use mathswatch, but to highlight the flaws that mathswatch includes in their system. I hope this encourages them to change their question/answer system to something more secure.

I believe the excessive use of javascript and public apis is the reason why mathswatch is so easy to cheat on and find information on. GO4Schools is pure html, so api's can't really be abused. myMaths uses randomized variables for their answers, making cheating insanely difficult.

I am (obviously) not involved OR endorsed by mathswatch, go4schools or mymaths.
